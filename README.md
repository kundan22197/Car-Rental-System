# Car-Rental-System
A web application that implements a car rental system using the Django Framework and the MySQL database to store the data.

This project produces a Rental system. In the system, customers can rent a vehicle
based on make and model. Our system provides customers to have different pick-up and
drop- off locations and will impose late fee if the rental vehicle is returned beyond the
return date and time. The Customers can use upto one discount coupon to their final bill.
Customers who have a Corporate account will be by default given a certain fixed %
discount in their final invoice
